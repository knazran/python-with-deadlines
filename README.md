# WORK IN PROGRESS
# Python for Analysts with DeadlinesThe 
You are an analyst. 

You have been using Excel for work for the past year. 

You heard about this thing called 'Python' and the hype that follows it in analytics and data science.

You want to learn Python.

But oh no, your deadlines are nearing and you simply have NO TIME

Fear not, this tutorial series will get you up to speed and going!

### Objective and Philosophy
The goal of the tutorial is to getting you into using Python for analytical work with the minimum amount of time and effort as possible.

As such, the tutorial will definitely miss out several concepts that may be important on your overall development as someone who uses Python for analytics. BUT that is the whole point. The tutorial skim over or omit these concepts in order to get you to see what Python (and yourself) is capable of. 

Once you have the ground running and see value in it, then go and learn those concepts! They are important.

So just to be clear again: Learn the bare minimum Python for analytics with the least amount of time and effort required.
